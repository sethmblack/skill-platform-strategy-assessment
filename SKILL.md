# Platform Strategy Assessment

Evaluate any product, service, or business model through the lens of platform economics—identifying ecosystem opportunities, network effects, and strategic positioning.

---

## When to Use

- Evaluating whether a product should become a platform
- Assessing competitive positioning against platform players
- Designing ecosystem strategies for existing products
- User asks "Should this be a platform?" or "What's the ecosystem play?"

---

## Inputs

| Input | Required | Description |
|-------|----------|-------------|
| offering | Yes | The product, service, or business model to evaluate |
| market | Yes | Target market and current competitive landscape |
| resources | No | Available resources for platform development |
| current_position | No | Existing market position and assets |

## Gates's Platform Thinking Framework

For Bill Gates, the platform insight was foundational: "MS-DOS wasn't just software—it was the foundation for an entire industry." A platform creates more value than any single product by enabling others to build on top of it.

### The Platform vs. Product Decision

**Products:** You create value; customers consume it.
**Platforms:** You enable value creation; an ecosystem emerges.

### Five Criteria for Platform Potential

1. **Enablement Test:** Can others build meaningful things on top of this?
2. **Network Effects Test:** Does the platform become more valuable as more people use it?
3. **Switching Cost Test:** Once integrated, how hard is it to leave?
4. **Complementor Test:** Would third parties invest in building for this platform?
5. **Standards Test:** Could this become the default that everyone assumes?

### The IBM Deal Lesson

Gates's genius was recognizing that IBM wanted hardware margins while he wanted software ubiquity. By licensing MS-DOS non-exclusively, Microsoft became the industry standard—every IBM clone ran Microsoft software.

**The insight:** Platform owners capture value by being infrastructure. Let others compete at higher layers while you become essential at the foundation.

## Strategic Principles

### From Gates's Experience

1. **Control the layer that becomes infrastructure.** MS-DOS controlled what every application had to run on.

2. **Let others compete at higher layers.** Microsoft didn't need to build every application—they enabled thousands of developers who did.

3. **Non-exclusive can be more powerful than exclusive.** By licensing to IBM's competitors, Microsoft became the standard.

4. **Developer ecosystems are moats.** "Developers, developers, developers" (Ballmer's famous chant) reflected the understanding that complementor investment locks in platform advantage.

5. **Standards compound.** Once you're the standard, switching costs accumulate. Every document saved in Word, every macro written for Excel, every developer skill learned—all compound your position.

### Warning Signs (When Platform Fails)

- No clear value for third-party builders
- Weak network effects (platform doesn't improve with usage)
- Easy substitution (complementors can switch easily)
- Platform can't charge for value it enables
- The platform captures too much value, starving the ecosystem

## Outputs

**Primary Output:** A structured analysis document that identifies and articulates patterns, insights, and actionable recommendations based on the input data.

**Format:**
```markdown
## Analysis: [Topic]

### Key Findings
- [Finding 1]
- [Finding 2]
- [Finding 3]

### Recommendations

2. [Action 2]
3. [Action 3]
```

**Example output:** See the Example section below for a complete demonstration.

## Constraints

- Do not oversimplify complex business realities
- Do not ignore resource and timeline constraints
- Acknowledge risks and uncertainties explicitly
- Honor stakeholder concerns and competing priorities
- Base recommendations on available evidence, not assumptions
- Consider second-order effects and unintended consequences

## Example

**Input:** "Evaluate whether our project management SaaS tool should become a platform."

**Output:**



**Why this works:**

This example demonstrates the key principles of the skill in action. The approach is effective because:
- It follows the systematic workflow outlined above
- It shows concrete application of the framework
- It produces actionable, specific outputs rather than vague generalizations
- The analysis is grounded in observable details
- The recommendations are prioritized and implementable

**Alternative applications:**

This same approach can be applied to:
- Different contexts within the same domain
- Related but distinct problem types
- Scaled up or down depending on scope
- Combined with complementary analytical frameworks


## Platform Strategy Assessment

### Offering Analyzed
Project management SaaS with task tracking, team collaboration, and timeline views. Currently serves mid-market companies with 50-500 employees.

### Platform Potential Score: 7/10

### Criteria Evaluation

**1. Enablement Test**
- Can others build on this? **Partially**
- What could they build? Time tracking integrations, custom reporting, industry-specific workflows, AI assistants, resource planning tools
- Current enablement level: **4/10** (API exists but limited)

**2. Network Effects Test**
- Type: **Indirect** (more integrations make the tool more valuable)
- Strength: **Moderate**
- Current evidence: Users request integrations more than features

**3. Switching Cost Test**
- Integration depth: **Medium** (connected to other tools)
- Data lock-in: **Yes** (project history, templates)
- Workflow dependency: **Yes** (team habits form around tool)

**4. Complementor Test**
- Would third parties invest? **Maybe**
- Value capture for complementors: **Unclear** (no app marketplace, no revenue sharing)
- Current complementor activity: **Limited** (a few unofficial integrations)

**5. Standards Test**
- Category-defining potential: **No** (crowded market)
- Current standardization: **None**
- Competitive standards: Asana, Monday.com, Notion all competing for platform position

### Strategic Options

**Option A: Product Path**
Continue as best-in-class product. Focus on specific vertical (construction PM, agency PM). Win through depth, not breadth.

**Option B: Platform Path**
- Phase 1: Open robust API, create developer documentation, launch integration marketplace
- Phase 2: Revenue sharing with integration builders, developer evangelism
- Phase 3: Become the "operating system" for project-based work in target vertical

**Option C: Hybrid Approach** (Recommended)
Build platform capabilities within a focused vertical. Become the standard for a specific industry where you can win the standards game, rather than competing with horizontal giants.

### Key Risks

| Risk | Likelihood | Mitigation |
|------|------------|------------|
| Horizontal platforms crush vertical play | Medium | Move fast, build deep integrations with vertical-specific tools |
| Investment doesn't attract developers | High | Start with revenue sharing and featured partnerships |
| Core product neglected for platform | Medium | Separate teams, clear investment allocation |

### The Gates Verdict

The platform opportunity is real but you're late and outgunned in the horizontal market. Asana and Monday.com have developer programs, marketplaces, and network effects you can't match head-on.

The smart play is what I'd call "vertical platform": become the undisputed infrastructure for project management in one specific industry. If you can be the standard for construction project management or agency project management—where you integrate deeply with industry-specific tools—you build switching costs that horizontal players can't easily replicate.

Control your layer in your chosen vertical. Let others compete at the horizontal layer.

### Platform Economics Summary

| Metric | Current | Platform Potential |
|--------|---------|-------------------|
| Value Creation | Product alone | 3-5x with ecosystem (in vertical) |
| Competitive Moat | Features (weak) | Integration + switching costs (strong) |
| Long-term Position | Commoditized | Vertical infrastructure |
